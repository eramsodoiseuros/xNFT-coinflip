# xNFT coinflip
 
ReactXnft is a library for building decentralized applications (DApps) that interact with the XNFT (eXtensible Non-Fungible Token) standard.

This code aims to create a user interface for a coin flip game that utilizes XNFTs, such as by allowing users to bet on the outcome of the coin flip using SPL tokens on the Solana blockchain.

# coinflip.tsx

In this example, the `XNFTProvider` component is used to provide the `contract address` and the `user's wallet address` to the rest of the component tree. The `XNFTCard` component is then used to display the `XNFT token`representing the coin being flipped. Finally, a button element is used to allow the user to initiate the coin flip.
